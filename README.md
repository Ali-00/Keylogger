# Keylogger
Keylogger is a type of surveillance software (considered to be either software or spyware) that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file, usually encrypted. A keylogger recorder can record instant messages, e-mail, and any information you type at any time using your keyboard. Some keylogger programs will also record any e-mail addresses you use and Web site URLs you visit. Keyloggers, as a surveillance tool, are often used by employers to ensureemployees use work computers for business purposes only. This keylogger captures the screen when the screen was a significant change, and save the keyboards.
